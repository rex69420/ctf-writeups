# CTF Writeups

This repository contains writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that I've participated in. Each writeup provides a detailed explanation of the challenge, the solution approach, and the steps taken to solve it.

## Structure

- Each CTF challenge has its own directory named after the challenge.
- Inside each challenge directory, you'll find the following:
  - `README.md` - Detailed writeup explaining the challenge and solution.
  - `handout/` - Directory containing the files provided as part of the challenge.
  - `solution/` - Directory containing the scripts, code, or tools used to solve the challenge.
  - `assets/` (Optional) - Directory containing screenshots or other media related to solving the challenge.
